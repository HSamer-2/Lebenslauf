About Kitty Kolumna
Kitty Kolumna is an award-winning investigative journalist. Kitty started her career in 2008 at the local catdistrict newspaper. She mainly wrote about local politics and economy. Kitty revealed the big expenses scandal in the local government in 2010. She won the national cat journalist award for her work – and got a job at the national TV station catsland TV. There, she developed the first investigative journalism department. Kitty led the department for eight years, until 2018. During her era, she revealed many scandals together with her team. The so-called #catgate, where the national chancellor wanted to sell the country’s basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity supply and services to a Russian millionaire, was one of them and brought her the second national cat journalist award. That exposure lead to troubles within catsland TV. As the national TV company got in the last years confronted with political influence, Kitty had many critics within the company. She recognized that it’s not possible to do investigate journalism there anymore. So, Kitty quit her job and founded her own investigate magazine, called catzine in 2018. There, she continued with her understanding of investigative journalism and revealed new political issues. The last one was in spring 2020: The previous interior minister of the right-wing party bought thousands of police horses. After the premature end of the government, he stole them and accused his Hungarian minister colleague of the act.
